## Refined Problem Statement:
Many South African property platforms, such as Property24, provide standard property listings with basic details like price, size, and location. However, these platforms often lack critical information necessary for potential buyers and tenants to make informed, lifestyle-based decisions about whether a property and its surrounding area are suitable. Users, especially first-time buyers and renters, frequently have to search multiple sources to find insights about crime rates, neighborhood demographics, public services, environmental risks, and property ownership history ​(Daily Investor)​(Seeff Blog).

Research suggests that property buyers and tenants in South Africa face challenges accessing enough data about the areas they want to live in, making it difficult to evaluate safety, service delivery, and other factors that significantly affect their lifestyle and long-term financial commitment​(Daily Investor). This gap in information leads to uncertainty, making it hard to determine whether an area is a good fit, both financially and personally​(Seeff Blog).

## Proposed Solution:
To address this problem, we propose an all-in-one platform that integrates key datasets from multiple sources to give users a holistic view of a property's potential. This platform would go beyond basic listings and offer comprehensive insights into:

- Crime statistics (local crime rates and trends)
- Ownership history (including any past legal disputes)
- Neighborhood demographics (age, income, and education levels)
- Investment potential (property appreciation trends and rental yields)
- Public services (availability of public transportation, schools, and healthcare)
- Infrastructure quality (roads, water, and electricity access)
- Environmental risks (flood zones, fire-prone areas)
- Local regulations (zoning laws, development plans)

The platform would aggregate data from government databases, public APIs (e.g., Google Places for nearby amenities), and third-party analytics platforms, offering users a consolidated view in a user-friendly interface. By centralizing this data, the platform would empower users to make well-informed, data-driven decisions regarding property purchases and rentals, eliminating the need to navigate multiple sources​
